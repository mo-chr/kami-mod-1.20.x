## How It Works

1. **Installation**
   - Place the mod file into your server's `mods` directory.

2. **Configuration**
   - Upon loading the mod, it will generate a JSON configuration file in the config folder. This file allows you to customize various aspects of the `/vote` command.
   - You can modify the colors, styling, and text displayed by the command.

4. **Reloading Configuration**
   - Use the command `/vote reload` to apply any changes made to the configuration file. Note that this command requires admin permissions.

5. **Usage**
   - Players can use the `/vote` command to view the list of links you have configured.

## Customization Options

- **Colors and Styling**: Customize the appearance of the text and links.
- **Text**: Modify the message displayed before the links.
- **Dynamic Links**: The plugin supports a dynamic number of links, adapting based on your configuration.
